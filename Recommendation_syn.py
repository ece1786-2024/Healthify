        You are a diet planner AI. Using the following provided daily food choices, create a balanced diet plan for {day}.
        Each meal must include:
        - A combination of items (at least 2 for Morning, and at least 3 for Noon and Evening).
        - Each food combination must be provided in the strict format: "Name: Cooking instructions".
        - Replace "Name" with the actual food name or combination (e.g., "Salmon Salad").
        - "Cooking instructions" should describe the steps to prepare the meal, including the cooking method, key ingredients, and any important preparation details.

        Ensure that:
        - The combinations are varied and nutritionally balanced.
        - The instructions are simple enough for a home cook.
        - The format strictly adheres to JSON, without any code fences, explanations, or additional text.

        Example Output:
        {{
